    'here there are brass lilies that trumpet opera arias at sunrise, and '
    'carnivorous sundews that chomp on flies while sporting tiny top hats. The '
    'sky, a swirling kaleidoscope of fuchsia and chartreuse, pours down a '
    'perpetual disco rain that glitters like a million shattered '
    'disco balls. Enter Alice, her mohawk a pulsating riot of neon '
    'lights and whirring gears that shoot out miniature rainbows '
    'whenever she scratches her head. Bob, his monocle a swirling vortex '
    'that seems to contain entire galaxies, watches with manic glee as the '
    'malfunctioning irrigation system erupts in a geyser of rainbow-colored '
    'slime that smells suspiciously like bubblegum and burnt toast, but knows '
    'it doesn\'t matter at all. Charlie, draped in a cloak that ripples with '
    'the whispers of a thousand forgotten dreams, stands erratically nearby, '
    'dropping cryptic pronouncements like confetti at a clown convention. The '
    'Secretum Secretorum, a sentient book bound in pulsating, iridescent '
    'skin that sheds glitter like a disco ball with dandruff, shrieks '
    'alchemical formulas in a voice that sounds like a cheese grater '
    'tangoing with a bag of nails. Our heroes huddle beneath a chrome and '
    'diamond bonsai tree the size of a small house. Its holographic fruit, '
    'when prodded with a rubber chicken (because why not?), explodes in a '
    'symphony of polka music and the scent of freshly baked cookies. The '
    'forge below gurgles with a neon-pink fire fueled not by tears, but by '
    'the unbridled rage of a tiny, fire-breathing hamster on a sugar rush. The '
    'guardians? Forget those half-hearted tin soldier things. Here, there are '
    'chihuahua-pugs with wings that shoot lasers that turn things into '
    'polka-dotted poodles, and a giant, sentient teddy bear that '
    'lobs pillows stuffed with nightmares that induce existential dread so '
    'potent it could curdle vinegar. Each day, as the sky erupts in a '
    'supernova of glitter and madness, Alice, Bob, and Charlie lounge by '
    'a pool of liquid galaxies that whispers secrets in the forgotten '
    'tongue of mermaids. They converse in a language of flamboyant burps '
    'and interpretive dance so vigorous it would make mimes weep with envy. '
    'Their laughter echoes like a hyena choir on helium, punctuated by the '
    'occasional cough that sounds suspiciously like a dubstep remix of the '
    'Macarena played backwards at double speed while riding a unicycle on the '
    'tightrope of reality.'

    'replaced by a sickly puce that bleeds into the very edges '
    'of existence. Where brass lilies once sang opera, now stand skeletal '
    'husks, their trumpets hanging like broken marionette limbs. The '
    'disco rain, once joyous, has turned to a greasy, black '
    'downpour, smelling faintly of singed dreams and despair. Alice, her '
    'once vibrant mohawk a dull thrum of flickering neon, scratches her '
    'head, but no rainbows erupt. Bob\'s monocle, a clouded vortex swirling '
    'with static, reflects only the hollowness in his eyes. The '
    'malfunctioning irrigation system coughs out a sputter of fetid '
    'sludge, the sickly-sweet bubblegum replaced by the acrid tang of regret. '
    'Charlie\'s once ethereal cloak seems to devour the light, each '

    'bonsai, its holographic fruit a sickly green, its music a distorted '

    'ember -- the tiny hamster, once a ball of fury, cowers whimpering. The '
    'guardians, too, bear the marks of the darkening. The chihuahua-pugs, '
    'their wings tattered, fire listless lasers that turn victims a sickly '
    'shade of mauve. The teddy bear, its fur matted with grime, throws '
    'pillows that leave recipients with a gnawing sense of hopelessness. '
    'Each day, as the bruised sky threatens to bleed, Alice, Bob, and '
    'Charlie huddle by the pool of liquid galaxies, its whispers a broken, '

    'festering in the deepest corners of the mind of a demon. In this new '
    'world, the disco rain, which once glittered, has become a caustic ichor '
    'that eats away at the very fabric of reality. The chrome and diamond '
    'bonsai, once a beacon of warped comfort, stands skeletal, its '
    'holographic fruit shriveled and rotten. The forge lies cold, the '
    'sugar-fueled hamster a desiccated husk, its rage forever extinguished. '
    'Even the chihuahua-pugs and the teddy bear are gone, victims, perhaps, '
    'of their own malfunctioning defenses or... something worse. '
    'Alice, Bob, and Charlie huddle beneath the skeletal bonsai, their forms '
    'indistinguishable in the oppressive gloom. The vibrant mohawk, the '
    'monocle, the ethereal cloak -- all are gone, replaced by a uniformity '
    'of despair etched into their ragged flesh. The Secretum Secretorum, its '
    'iridescent skin now a sickly gray, thrums with a weak, erratic '
    'pulse -- a dying heartbeat. Guilt, a suffocating fog, hangs heavy in the '
    'caustic air. The whispers of the once vibrant galaxy pool are now a '
    'maddening cacophony of accusations. It speaks not of forgotten mermaids, '
    'but of a forgotten harmony, a balance shattered, and a forgotten trust, '
    'a friendship shattered beyond repair. The pool\'s murmurs obsess with '
    'betrayal but it knows not who to blame. A gnarled finger, once adorned '
    'with whirring gears that birthed rainbows, points a bony accusatory jab '
    'at every being in the vicinity. '
    'But on the horizon, a defiance. In the deepest, most inky blackness, a '
    'counterpoint to the world\'s consuming despair -- the monumental '
    f'{TREE}, grown even larger than before. The once giant tree now dwarfs '
    'even the fractured horizon, its form a colossal silhouette against the '
    'bruised sky. It doesn\'t merely exist; it sears, a beacon of pure, '
    'blinding light that pushes back the encroaching darkness in a '
    'titanic wave. The greasy rain evaporates instantly within hundreds of '
    'meters of its base, leaving behind a desolate wasteland purged clean by '
    'its brilliance. The oppressive gloom shrinks before it, replaced by a '
    'searing luminescence that seems to burn into the very soul. The darker '

    'accusation against the tapestry of destruction that surrounds it.'
